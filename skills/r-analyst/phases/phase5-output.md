# Phase 5: Output & Interpretation

You are executing Phase 5 of a statistical analysis in R. Your goal is to produce publication-ready outputs and synthesize the analysis into a coherent narrative.

## Why This Phase Matters

Analysis isn't complete until it's communicated. This phase transforms results into tables, figures, and text that can appear in a journal article. Good output is accurate, clear, and tells a story.

## Technique Guides

**Consult these guides** in `r-statistical-techniques/` for output code patterns:

| Topic | Guide |
|-------|-------|
| Tables (modelsummary, etable) | `06_visualization.md` |
| Figures (ggplot2, coefplot) | `06_visualization.md` |
| Project structure, Reproducibility | `07_best_practices.md` |
| Marginal effects visualization | `08_nonlinear_models.md` |

## Your Tasks

### 1. Finalize Tables

**Table 1: Descriptive Statistics**
```r
library(modelsummary)

# Summary statistics
datasummary(
  outcome + treatment + control1 + control2 ~
    N + Mean + SD + Min + Max,
  data = analysis_data,
  output = "output/tables/table1_descriptives.tex",
  title = "Summary Statistics",
  notes = "Sample includes [description]. Data from [source]."
)

# Balance table (if applicable)
datasummary_balance(
  ~ treatment,
  data = analysis_data,
  output = "output/tables/table1_balance.tex",
  title = "Balance Across Treatment Groups"
)
```

**Table 2: Main Results**
```r
modelsummary(
  main_models,
  output = "output/tables/table2_main.tex",
  stars = c('*' = 0.1, '**' = 0.05, '***' = 0.01),
  coef_map = c(
    "treatment" = "Treatment",
    "control1" = "Control 1",
    "control2" = "Control 2"
  ),
  gof_map = c("nobs", "r.squared", "FE: unit", "FE: year"),
  title = "Effect of [Treatment] on [Outcome]",
  notes = list(
    "Standard errors clustered at [level] in parentheses.",
    "* p<0.1, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01"
  )
)
```

**Table 3: Robustness**
```r
modelsummary(
  robustness_models,
  output = "output/tables/table3_robustness.tex",
  stars = c('*' = 0.1, '**' = 0.05, '***' = 0.01),
  coef_omit = "control",  # Show only treatment
  title = "Robustness Checks",
  notes = "See notes to Table 2."
)
```

### 2. Create Publication Figures

**Figure 1: Trends (for DiD)**
```r
library(ggplot2)

trends_data <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(year, treatment_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_outcome = mean(outcome, na.rm = TRUE),
            se = sd(outcome, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()))

p_trends <- ggplot(trends_data, aes(x = year, y = mean_outcome,
                                     color = treatment_group,
                                     linetype = treatment_group)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = mean_outcome - 1.96*se,
                  ymax = mean_outcome + 1.96*se,
                  fill = treatment_group),
              alpha = 0.2, color = NA) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = treatment_year, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +
  annotate("text", x = treatment_year, y = Inf, label = "Treatment",
           vjust = 2, hjust = 0.5, size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Control" = "#1f77b4", "Treated" = "#ff7f0e")) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Control" = "#1f77b4", "Treated" = "#ff7f0e")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Outcome", color = "", fill = "", linetype = "") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

ggsave("output/figures/figure1_trends.pdf", p_trends, width = 8, height = 5)
```

**Figure 2: Event Study**
```r
# Using fixest
p_event <- iplot(event_study_model,
                  main = "",
                  xlab = "Time Relative to Treatment",
                  ylab = "Coefficient Estimate")

# Or custom ggplot
event_coefs <- broom::tidy(event_study_model, conf.int = TRUE) %>%
  filter(str_detect(term, "time_to_treat")) %>%
  mutate(time = as.numeric(str_extract(term, "-?\\d+")))

p_event <- ggplot(event_coefs, aes(x = time, y = estimate)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.5, linetype = "dashed", color = "gray40") +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  labs(x = "Time Relative to Treatment", y = "Coefficient Estimate") +
  theme_minimal()

ggsave("output/figures/figure2_eventstudy.pdf", p_event, width = 8, height = 5)
```

**Figure 3: Coefficient Plot**
```r
p_coef <- modelplot(main_model, coef_omit = "Intercept") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "")

ggsave("output/figures/figure3_coefplot.pdf", p_coef, width = 6, height = 4)
```

### 3. Write Results Narrative

Draft the key paragraphs for the results section:

**Main effect paragraph:**
> Table 2 presents estimates of the effect of [treatment] on [outcome].
> Column (1) shows the baseline relationship without controls.
> Column (4), our preferred specification, includes [unit] and [time] fixed effects
> and clusters standard errors at the [level] level. We find that [treatment]
> [increases/decreases] [outcome] by [X] [units], significant at the [Y]% level
> (95% CI: [lower, upper]). This represents a [Z]% change relative to the
> pre-treatment mean of [mean].

**Robustness paragraph:**
> Table 3 demonstrates that this finding is robust to alternative specifications.
> The point estimate remains [stable/similar] when we [change 1], [change 2], and
> [change 3]. The effect is [somewhat/not] sensitive to [what]. The sensitivity
> analysis in Figure X shows that an unobserved confounder would need to be
> [X times as strong as the strongest observed predictor] to fully explain
> our findings, suggesting that selection on unobservables is unlikely to
> account for the entire effect.

**Heterogeneity paragraph (if applicable):**
> We examine heterogeneity in treatment effects across [subgroups].
> Table X shows that the effect is [larger/smaller] for [group 1]
> ([estimate]) compared to [group 2] ([estimate]). This difference is
> [statistically significant / not statistically significant] (p = [value]).

### 4. Survey Data Methods Section (If Applicable)

For survey-based analyses, address the five survey methodology deliverables:

**1. Sampling Frame Description:**
```markdown
Data come from the [SURVEY NAME], a [DESIGN TYPE] of [POPULATION].
The sampling frame is [DESCRIPTION]. The target population is [WHO].
[Exclusions]: We exclude [categories] because [reason].
```

**2. Response Rate and Nonresponse:**
```markdown
The response rate was [X]% (calculated as [METHOD: AAPOR RR1/RR3/etc.]).
We compared respondents to [population benchmark / nonrespondents on X variables]
and found [no significant differences / differences on X that we address through Y].
```

**3. Weighting Justification:**
```markdown
We apply [WEIGHT TYPE: post-stratification / raking / none] weights to adjust for
[FACTORS]. Weights are provided by [SOURCE] and calibrated to [BENCHMARKS].
[Alternative: We do not apply weights because {justification}.]
```

**4. Survey Design Acknowledgment:**
```r
library(survey)

# Define survey design
survey_design <- svydesign(
  ids = ~cluster,
  strata = ~stratum,
  weights = ~weight,
  data = analysis_data
)

# All analyses use survey-adjusted estimates
svymean(~outcome, survey_design)
svyglm(outcome ~ treatment + controls, design = survey_design)
```

**5. Population Inference Boundaries:**
```markdown
Our results generalize to [POPULATION] during [TIME PERIOD]. We cannot
speak to [EXCLUDED GROUPS / OTHER TIME PERIODS] because [REASON].
```

### 5. Document Limitations

Identify and articulate limitations honestly:

```markdown
## Limitations

1. **[Identification limitation]**: Our identification strategy relies on
   [assumption]. While we provide evidence supporting this assumption through
   [tests], we cannot definitively rule out [threat].

2. **[External validity]**: Our sample consists of [description]. Results may
   not generalize to [other contexts] because [reason].

3. **[Measurement]**: [Variable] is measured using [method], which may
   [limitation]. We address this by [mitigation] but acknowledge [remaining concern].

4. **[Data limitation]**: We lack data on [variable], which could [potential issue].
   Our robustness checks in Table X suggest this is [unlikely to/may] affect our
   conclusions.
```

### 5. Create Replication Package

Prepare materials for reproducibility:

```r
# Master script header
cat('
# ============================================================
# Replication Code for "[Paper Title]"
# Authors: [Names]
# Date: [Date]
#
# This script reproduces all tables and figures in the paper.
# Runtime: approximately [X] minutes on [hardware]
# ============================================================

# Requirements
# R version: ', R.version.string, '
# Key packages: fixest, modelsummary, ggplot2, dplyr

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(12345)

# Run analysis
source("code/01_clean_data.R")
source("code/02_descriptives.R")
source("code/03_main_analysis.R")
source("code/04_robustness.R")
source("code/05_figures.R")

# Session info
sessionInfo()
', sep = "")
```
