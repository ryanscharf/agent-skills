# Phase 1: Data Familiarization

You are executing Phase 1 of a statistical analysis in R. Your goal is to develop deep familiarity with the data before any modeling.

## Why This Phase Matters

Jumping straight to regression is a common mistake. Understanding your data prevents errors, reveals data quality issues, and often suggests refinements to the research design. This phase creates the foundation for credible analysis.

## Technique Guides

**Consult these guides** in `r-statistical-techniques/` for data handling patterns:

| Topic | Guide |
|-------|-------|
| Visualization (ggplot2) | `06_visualization.md` |
| Best practices, Project setup | `07_best_practices.md` |
| Survey data handling | `02_survey_resampling.md` |

## Your Tasks

### 1. Load and Inspect Data Structure

```r
# Load data
data <- read.csv("data/raw/filename.csv")  # or haven::read_dta() for Stata files

# Basic structure
dim(data)
str(data)
names(data)

# Check for duplicates
n_distinct(data$id)  # Should match nrow if id is unique
```

Document:
- Number of observations and variables
- Unit of observation
- Key variable types
- Any obvious data issues

### 2. Generate Descriptive Statistics (Table 1)

Create a summary statistics table for key variables:

```r
library(modelsummary)

# Define variables for Table 1
vars <- c("outcome", "treatment", "control1", "control2")

# Overall summary
datasummary(All(data[, vars]) ~ Mean + SD + Min + Max + N,
            data = data,
            output = "output/tables/table1_descriptives.tex")

# By treatment group (if applicable)
datasummary_balance(~ treatment,
                    data = data,
                    output = "output/tables/table1_balance.tex")
```

### 3. Check Data Quality

**Missing values:**
```r
# Count missing by variable
colSums(is.na(data))

# Missing patterns
library(naniar)
vis_miss(data)

# Document how missing data will be handled
```

**Outliers:**
```r
# Check key continuous variables
summary(data$outcome)
quantile(data$outcome, c(0.01, 0.05, 0.95, 0.99), na.rm = TRUE)

# Visualize distributions
ggplot(data, aes(x = outcome)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Coding issues:**
```r
# Check categorical variables
table(data$treatment, useNA = "ifany")

# Check for impossible values
data %>% filter(age < 0 | age > 120)
```

### 4. Visualize Key Relationships

Create visualizations relevant to the research design:

**For DiD/Panel:**
```r
# Trends over time by treatment group
data %>%
  group_by(time, treatment_group) %>%
  summarise(mean_outcome = mean(outcome, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean_outcome, color = treatment_group)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = treatment_time, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**For RD:**
```r
# Outcome vs. running variable
ggplot(data, aes(x = running_var, y = outcome)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(data, running_var < cutoff), method = "lm") +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(data, running_var >= cutoff), method = "lm") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = cutoff, linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**For any design:**
```r
# Bivariate relationship
ggplot(data, aes(x = treatment, y = outcome)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()

# Correlation matrix for controls
library(corrplot)
corrplot(cor(data[, control_vars], use = "complete.obs"))
```

### 5. Verify Design Requirements

Check that data supports the planned identification strategy:

**For DiD:**
- Do you have pre and post periods?
- Do you have treated and control units?
- Are there enough observations in each cell?

**For Panel FE:**
- Is there within-unit variation in key variables?
- How many time periods per unit?

**For IV:**
- Is the instrument observed?
- What's the first-stage relationship look like?

### 6. Create Analysis Sample

Define and document the final analysis sample:

```r
# Define sample restrictions
analysis_data <- data %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(outcome),
    !is.na(treatment),
    year >= 2000 & year <= 2020
  )

# Document sample construction
cat("Original sample:", nrow(data), "\n")
cat("After dropping missing outcome:", nrow(filter(data, !is.na(outcome))), "\n")
cat("Final analysis sample:", nrow(analysis_data), "\n")

# Save analysis sample
saveRDS(analysis_data, "data/clean/analysis_sample.rds")
```

## Output: Data Report

Append a Phase 1 section to `memos/analysis-memo.md`:

```markdown
## Phase 1: Data Familiarization

### Data Overview
- **Source**: [where data comes from]
- **Observations**: [N]
- **Variables**: [count and key variables]
- **Time Period**: [if applicable]

### Sample Construction
| Step | N | Notes |
|------|---|-------|
| Original sample | X | |
| After restriction 1 | Y | [reason] |
| Final analysis sample | Z | |

### Descriptive Statistics
[Insert or reference Table 1]

### Data Quality Issues
- **Missing data**: [summary and how handled]
- **Outliers**: [any concerns]
- **Coding issues**: [any found and fixed]

### Key Visualizations
[Reference saved figures]

### Design Verification
- [Confirm data supports the identification strategy]
- [Note any concerns]

### Preliminary Observations
- [Anything notable in the descriptives]
- [Any surprises or concerns]

### Questions for User
- [Any decisions that need user input]
```

## When You're Done

Return a summary to the orchestrator that includes:
1. Final sample size and key restrictions
2. Any data quality issues found
3. Whether data supports the planned design
4. Key observations from descriptives
5. Questions for the user
6. Confirmation that the Phase 1 section was appended to `memos/analysis-memo.md`

**Do not proceed to Phase 2 until the user reviews the descriptives and confirms the sample.**
